Community is a word that gets thrown around a lot these days, and has been diluted in its meaning.\nFor the sake of this course, and the goals of SJMD more broadly, we\u0026rsquo;re using \u0026ldquo;real community\u0026rdquo; to mean, in short, \u0026ldquo;connection + interdependence.\u0026rdquo;\nFor a longer definition, we\u0026rsquo;ll draw from Chapter 22 of Charles Eisenstein\u0026rsquo;s book Sacred Economics (emphasis ours):\n Community, which in today’s parlance usually means proximity or a mere network, is a much deeper kind of connection than that: it is a sharing of one’s being, an expansion of one’s self. To be in community is to be in personal, interdependent relationship, and it comes with a price: our illusion of independence, our freedom from obligation. You can’t have it both ways. If you want community, you must be willing to be obligated, dependent, tied, attached. You will give and receive gifts that you cannot just buy somewhere. You will not be able to easily find another source. You need each other.\n    CHAPTER: Community and the Unquantifiable / Charles Eisenstein, Sacred Economics  "},{"uri":"/hail-mary/","title":"A Hail Mary","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Dot-Com-Munity A Hail Mary Talking about what we\u0026rsquo;re going to be talking about, and creating real community, online \u0026ndash; well, it\u0026rsquo;s a long shot.

Watch his TED talk, or read his book, and you\u0026rsquo;ll beging to get sense of how fragile this project is.\n   TED: How One Tweet Can Ruin Your Life / Jon Ronson   BOOK: So You’ve Been Publicly Shamed / Jon Ronson  "},{"uri":"/hail-mary/what-worries-us/","title":"What Worries Us","tags":[],"description":"","content":"Even before you met Jon Ronson, our guess is you had some worries about joining this online community. Further, we bet that people in your lives (who aren\u0026rsquo;t in this course) have some thoughts on this as well.\nAsk around (via posting an open question on Facebook/Twitter, texting friends, at the lunch table, etc.) and get a sense for whether people in your life are worried about saying the wrong thing online. If so, what shape does that worry take? Try to hear from at least 5 people. The more the better.  We\u0026rsquo;d love to hear what you think, and what you hear from people in your life.

Creating it online is even harder. And creating it, and sustaining it, when talking about social justice dogma \u0026ndash; or any hot-button, volatile issue \u0026ndash; is nigh impossible.\nBut if we can figure out a way to work \u0026ldquo;nigh\u0026rdquo; into a sentence in 2019, we can figure out a way to create authentic connection and interdependence online.\nIn the rest of this Module \u0026ldquo;Dot-Com-Munity\u0026rdquo;, we\u0026rsquo;ll be elaborating on how things blow up online, how to protect yourself (and ourselves), some of the forces at play, and some counter-forces we can apply.\n"}]
