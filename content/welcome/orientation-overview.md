Orientation has a bunch of Topics that you will progress through as you click the "Next" buttons at the bottom of each page.

If youâ€™re on a big screen, youâ€™ll see them on the left under the â€œOrientation" header (if you're on a mobile device, click the three bars icon).

**You can likely buzz through Orientation in about 45 minutes, give or take**. You're welcome to take longer, of course. This isn't a race.

And know that this will all be here for you to refer back to throughout the course (you will not be tested on this ðŸ˜¬).
