Because we know that cognitive biases are influencing our thinking, that [they are innumerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), _and_ that they are likely to derail our conversation, we are in a good spot: we can (try to) do something about it.

Here's what we've committed to doing in the [SJMD Community](https://community.sjmd.space), in the spirit of ["Name it to tame it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDLzppD4Jc), that we encourage you to put into place in your life, with your community, friends, colleagues, or anyone else with whom you're talking about SJMD-related issues:

1. If we notice that someone seems to be making a point that is influenced by a particular cognitive bias, we'll name it.
2. When people suggest we're being influenced by a particular cognitive bias, we'll thank them and consider it.
3. And, when we're feeling particularly thoughtful, we'll name the cognitive biases that might be influencing our perspective on a point we're making, _while_ we're making it.

\#3 is the pie in the sky. But \#1 and \#2 are more down to Earth, and might actually work, provided **when we're doing \#1 we simply name (and don't blame)**, and **when we're doing \#2 we focus on the thanking, and not defending/deflecting.**
