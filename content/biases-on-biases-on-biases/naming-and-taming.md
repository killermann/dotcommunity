Because we know that cognitive biases are influencing our thinking, that [they are innumerable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases), _and_ that they are likely to derail our conversation, we are in a good spot: we can (try to) do something about it.

Here's what we are going to commit to do, in the spirit of ["Name it to tame it"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcDLzppD4Jc):

1. If we notice that someone seems to be making a point that is influenced by a particular cognitive bias, we'll name it.
2. When people suggest we're being influenced by a particular cognitive bias, we'll thank them and consider it.
3. And, when we're feeling particularly thoughtful, we'll name the cognitive biases that might be influencing our perspective on a point we're making, _while_ we're making it.

\#3 is the pie in the sky. But \#1 and \#2 are more down to Earth, and might actually work, provided **when we're doing \#1 we simply name (and don't blame)**, and **when we're doing \#2 we focus on the thanking, and not defending/deflecting.**

Ultimately, we also have to commit to something a little bit bigger: that we're all works in progress, none of us are perfect, and we're going to try our best on this, and fail regularly. And that failing, learning, growing, are all okay things to do. Not just on our own but with others present.

What might that look like? Want to practice? **Head to the Community and give it a shot.**
