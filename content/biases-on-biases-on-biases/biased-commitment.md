Confronting our biases -- as individuals, and as a community -- is a challenging proposition. Without question, it's something that would require commitment.

And we have to commit to something a little bit bigger: that we're all works in progress, none of us are perfect, and we're going to try our best on this, and fail regularly. And that failing, learning, growing, are all okay things to do. Not just on our own but with others present.

That's a bias we're willing to commit to.
