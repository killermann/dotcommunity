Once you start to learn about cognitive biases, it starts to feel like you learn about a new one every day, and see them everywhere.

Even that feeling itself _is a cognitive bias_ called [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias).

**Here's a huge list of cognitive biases, including their names, descriptions, and links to learn more:**

At the risk of this course straying from being "Social Justice, Minus Dogma" into "Cognitive Biases, Plus Cognitive Biases" **we're not going to attempt to list them all, nor expect you to know them all.**

Just know that, like Seinfeld episodes, there's a cognitive bias to explain just about every irrational decision or viewpoint you might encounter.

If you want to dig into a few more that weren't among the 20 in the edugraphic, **here are a few that we see as particularly common in social justice dogma conversations:**

1. [Hanlon's Razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor): a form of [fundamental attribution error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error) where we attribute to malice what can be more easily explained otherwise (e.g., by stupidity)
2. [Halo Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect): assuming other positive traits about a person based on noticing one positive trait
3. [False-Consensus Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_consensus_effect): over-estimating how much other people think, believe, or feel how you do
