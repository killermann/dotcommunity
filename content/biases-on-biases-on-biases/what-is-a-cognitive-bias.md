"Cognitive biases" are ways our thinking is unconsciously influenced to distort reality, mistaking our subjective view of something for the objective truth.

The phrase/idea is attributed to [Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/185/4157/1124), and has since been popularized by Kahneman in his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow."

**A lot of what leads to the "impossibility" of difficult conversation can be pegged on cognitive biases.**

Or, put another way, we're particularly likely to crash a conversation when our cognitive biases are in the driver's seat.

If this is a new idea to you, and the explanations aren't making it more clear, or you're not sure how it relates to our goals here, examples will probably help.
