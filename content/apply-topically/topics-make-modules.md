Each _Module_ is made up of a bunch of related _Topics_.

The Topic you're currently completing, for example, is called **Apply Topically**. It has several steps within it, all of which you can see in the navigation.

Sometimes a topic will have a prompt (like **Tell Us About Yourself**, which you completed earlier), and sometimes they'll be purely informational.
