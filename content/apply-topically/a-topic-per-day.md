While you are, of course, welcome to pace yourself however you'd like, we've designed the course with one cutesy rule:

**Within each of the main course Modules there are 7 topics. If you feel so inclined, you can pop in once a day, complete the topic of that day, then pop out.**

This will help you stay engaged, keep absorbing, and give you time to digest big ideas.

It will also stagger things nicely for your participation in the Community, something we haven't really talked about yet. So let's talk about that.
