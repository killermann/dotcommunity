The online community exists here to serve as a support system for bringing these conversations into your real life. To do that, you'll need to have these conversations _outside_ of the SJMD Community.

We'll start small.

Pick a friend who you'll call at least once a week (or grab coffee/tea, or whatever you do with your friends) to talk through what's happening in the Course. They don't need to be an expert on all things Social Justice, Minus Dogma -- or even well versed. Just someone you trust to confide in, who has at least an interest in these ideas. And they cannot be in the course.

**Do this right now. Send them a text and ask them if they're up for being your phone a friend** (enthusiastic consent is the goal here, as elsewhere), and let them know you'll be wanting to chat at least once a week.
