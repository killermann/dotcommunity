We also want you to hold us accountable, and contribute to improving the Course and Community. We'll provide specific outlets for this regularly, and there are a few always-available ways to feed back.

See the little "Suggest Edits" and "Get Help" links at the bottom of this page? They're on most of the course steps.

**Suggest edits** will take you directly to where this course app file lives on GitHub, and you can recommend a change (e.g., if we're doing something wrong, there's a typo, or a better way to phrase something).  

**Get help** will take you to a page with other links and pathways to find support, or call attention to issues.

And you can always email us (socialjusticeminusdogma@gmail.com will go to the course Facilitators)
