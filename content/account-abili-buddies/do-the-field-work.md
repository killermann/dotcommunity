We'll also be providing you with what we're calling "Fieldwork" throughout the course, in addition to the readings, listenings, and watchings.

```
Fieldwork will look like this, to make it super obvious that it's not your average paragraph of info. It will always have a direct call to action, like this: If you haven't picked you phone-a-friend friend yet, please pick your phone your friend.
```

Generally, Fieldwork will prompt you to put something theoretical within the course into action, or to gather feedback or input from outside sources in your life.

**Everything in this course is challenge by choice.** You can opt out if you're not up for, or able to do, anything.

That all said, we're here to challenge our personal comfort, prioritizing bravery over ideological safety. So be brave!
