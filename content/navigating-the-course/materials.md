One of the ways you'll be finding answers to the guiding questions is through the course materials and links.

**We're doing our best to make all of the materials accessible.** So we won't be linking to articles that are behind paywalls, and when we recommend a book chapter, we'll make sure it's library-available (and give you a non-book alternative).

**Just keep an eye out at the top and bottom of each screen here for links and buttons.**

If there's something mentioned in a step and you're not sure how to find it, it's probably a new button on the page (between the "Back" and "Next").
