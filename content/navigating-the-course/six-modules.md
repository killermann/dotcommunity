Not counting Orientation and Graduation, the course is comprised of 6 Modules.

![You are here arrow pointing to orientation, with the other six modules and graduation in a timeline to the right](/images/you-are-here.jpg)

You'll get an email every week with a link to the next Module (you should already have an email with a link to Module 1). You cannot progress through the course faster than that, but **you are welcome to take as much time as you need.**
