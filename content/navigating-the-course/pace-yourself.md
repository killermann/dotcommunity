When you start Module 1, we encourage you to take however long you need to make your participation in the course a meaningful experience.

**Use the guiding questions as a guide to know when you're ready to move on to the next Module.** Having satisfying answers to those questions is more important than what the calendar says.

Also, the Topics and steps within each Module are broken up into bite-sized pieces. Our goal is to only have one idea per each page. This can make it easier to take breaks.

You've likely noticed little checkmarks popping up when you've visited a page (look to the left, or open the menu if you're on your phone). Those are breadcrumbs you can use to find your way back to the Topic you left off on.

Let's talk more about that.
