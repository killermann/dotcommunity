Discourse has a groovy A.I. named Discobot who has your back. They've already sent you a "Greetings" message that's waiting for you in your inbox (you may have already seen it).

We'll pass the torch for the rest of the Navigating the Community part of orientation to Discobot.

If you want more of an intro to Discourse, click the "discuss" link on this page (top icon or bottom botton) to view Discobot's message. Follow the instructions instructions there (by bookmarking the personal message) and Discobot will walk you through an a tutorial.

Enjoy the ride ðŸ¤–.
