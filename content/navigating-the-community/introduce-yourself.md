One important thing we want to say first: **anonymity is an integral part of the SJMD Course + Community**, and serves to both protect you individually, and the community as a whole.

With that in mind, **please do not include your full name in your username** (first name + last initial is great, or just initials), and be mindful when adding your location.

To edit your profile...

1. Head to [community.sjmd.space](https://community.sjmd.space).
2. Click on your user icon in the top right (will likely be your first initial)
3. Click the cog ⚙️ for Preferences
4. Click "Profile" in the sidebar
5. Follow the instructions there
