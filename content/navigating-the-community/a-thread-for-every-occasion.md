The community is organized to allow for compartmentalized discussion of all the topics in the course. There are also places to start new topics, and dive into different ideas.

Within the community, you’ll find categories for each of the Modules, as well as threads (focused discussions on a particular idea) for the Topics within those Modules.

**Whenever there is a parallel discussion thread for the material you’re currently viewing, you’ll see a little speech bubble up top, and a "Discuss" button down below.** Click either one to jump directly to the related discussion.

Do you see them on this page?

Click one now to visit the overall Course Category in the Community. And feel free to click around and follow your curiosity there! We'll be waiting here when you get back.
