As we alluded to earlier, we're focusing on online communities in the hopes of applying the lessons to our potential social justice (minus dogma) community formation. 

**So it might feel important for us to disambiguate "community" from "online community" and "in-person community."** And we have a whole Module dedicated to this (Module 6). 

Here's all you need to know right now: in the context of SJD, the boundaries between "online" and "in-person" community are blurry to the point of non-existent, because what gains momentum in online SJ communities gets enforced in our local movement spaces.

What happens online **does not** stay online.
