We don't see any of this working without real community. "This" being SJMD, or achieving the goals of social justice in general. **Community is the foundation upon which everything else might be built.**

If there's something you need from us, don't hesitate to ask. We'd love to do what we can to help!

Remember, needs aren't bad, and they're not _just_ good -- they're necessary.
