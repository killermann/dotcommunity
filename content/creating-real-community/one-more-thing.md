Let's glue this all together by adding one more idea to the mix: Johnson & Johnson's Social Interdependence Theory.

Elaborating on the interdependence concept from Eisenstein's explanation of what we need for real community, we have this:

>"Positive interdependence exists when individuals perceive that they can reach their goals if and  only  if  the  other  individuals  with  whom  they  are  cooperatively  linked  also  reach  their goals and, therefore, promote each otherâ€™s efforts to achieve the goals."
