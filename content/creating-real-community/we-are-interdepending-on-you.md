This Course + Community doesn't happen without you. No exaggeration there, obviously. Without you, we'd just be talking to ourselves.

And it doesn't happen without us. No horn tooting, humbly. Someone's gotta flip the switches and put the 1s and 0s in the right order.

So we have the beginnings of interdependence. Of true need. We'll need to lean into that.

**In the next module we'll start talking directly about social justice dogma. Everything we've learned here will be tested.**

We haven't talked about social justice dogma yet, and it might feel like we haven't even come close to covering social justice, _minus_ dogma.

_But if we can create real community, we might be closer than you think..._
