Social justice dogma is bigger than us. And everything we're doing at SJMD won't mean anything without you.

And if this Course, or the SJMD Community or Hub, are helpful for you, then you're depending on us -- at least in a small way.

So we have the beginnings of interdependence. It will be up to you to create interdependence in your life, within your communities, amongst your friends / colleagues / classmates / others in your local movements.

**In the next Module we'll start talking directly about social justice dogma. Everything you've learned in this Module about community will be tested.**

We haven't talked about social justice dogma yet, and it might feel like we haven't even come close to covering social justice, _minus_ dogma.

_But if we can create real community, we might be closer than you think..._
