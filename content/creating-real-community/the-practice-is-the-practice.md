Everything we've covered to create real community here is practice.

We're trying things out, putting theory into practice, experimenting with different ways to disagree, explain things, argue, explore, support, and agree. All in the service of being able create a container that's durable enough to hold combustible conversations.

They are things we're testing in the SJMD Community, and ideas we're covering in this course, but they can't just live here. We need to practice them outside of the course, in our real lives.

**Our ultimate goal isn't to create community, creating community is a necessary step to accomplish our goal: plotting a path toward equity, avoiding the pitfalls of dogma.**

And here's the thing: if you can succeed in creating real community, and find ways to talk about social justice without dogma _while remaining in community_, you'll be accomplishing the goal in real-time.

The practice is the practice.
