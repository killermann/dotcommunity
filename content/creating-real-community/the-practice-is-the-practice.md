Everything we're doing to create real community here, for the SJMD Course + Community, is practice.

We're trying things out, putting theory into practice, experimenting with different ways to disagree, explain things, argue, explore, support, and agree. All in the service of being able create a container that's durable enough to hold combustible conversations.

But it can't stop here, in _this_ community, at _community dot sjmd dot space_.

**Our ultimate goal here isn't to create community, creating community is a necessary step to accomplish our goal: plotting a path toward equity, avoiding the pitfalls of dogma.**

And here's the thing: if we can succeed in creating real community here, and find ways to talk about social justice without dogma _while remaining in community_, we'll be accomplishing the goal in real-time.

**Because it's not just here that we need real community in order to make steps toward living social justice.**

The practice is the practice.
