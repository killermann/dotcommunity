Do you have one password, maybe with like 11 different variations based on requirements, that you used to create your SJMD account?

<small>(_Add a !_, "Did that work? No?"" _Capitalize the first letter_, "Okay, all set.")</small>

We hear you. We understand. We were you, once. We miss that Us sometimes.

**Now change it.**

You can access your account by going to [sjmd.memberful.com](https://sjmd.memberful.com). We'll even _magic_ it into a pop-up on this page to make it even easier.

[Follow the guide's password advice](https://onlinesafety.feministfrequency.com/en/#passwords-login-security) and set up a password that makes Fort Knox look inviting.

<script data-no-instant type="text/javascript">
  window.MemberfulOptions = {site: "https://sjmd.memberful.com"};

  (function() {
    var s   = document.createElement('script');

    s.type  = 'text/javascript';
    s.async = true;
    s.src   = 'https://d35xxde4fgg0cx.cloudfront.net/assets/embedded.js';

    setup = function() { window.MemberfulEmbedded.setup(); }

    s.addEventListener("load", setup, false);

    ( document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] ).appendChild( s );
  })();
</script>
