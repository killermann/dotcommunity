Whenever you're sharing examples in the Community, talking about yourself, or referring to other people, be specifically vague.

What we mean by this is that words like "someone" or "somewhere" (super vague âœ…) are unhelpful. They don't provide enough context for meaningful dialogue.

And identifiers like "Ted 'Theodore' Logan" or "San Dimas High School" are unsafely specific. ([Don't catch the reference?](https://billandted.fandom.com/wiki/Ted_%22Theodore%22_Logan))

Instead, **be specifically vague by saying "a student at a California urban high school" we get all the context we need**, without the risk. You can even say "he's breathtaking." (If you didn't catch that reference, you're on your own.)
