Now [make yourself un-doxx-able](https://onlinesafety.feministfrequency.com/en/) by considering (at least) these three things:

1. **Change usernames to not include your name if your name is unique or easily identifiable.** If you don't want people to be able to connect you to an account you have online (e.g., if you are a member in the SJMD Community), make sure your username isn't firstname_lastname :)
2. **Change your profile picture to something that isn't reverse-image-search-able.** Even if your username is anonymous, people can easily connect the dots if your profile picture is your actual face, and easily if that is the same profile picture you use for another account that _isn't_ anonymous.
3. **Don't name your location if you're in a small town, or the only person in your area doing social justice work.** Your location might be enough for someone to figure out who you are, if your name + location are connected on some other google-able site (e.g., a staff profile), especially if there are similar keywords in both spaces.
