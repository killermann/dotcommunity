Now [make yourself un-doxx-able](https://onlinesafety.feministfrequency.com/en/) by considering (at least) these three things:

1. **Change your username if your name is unique or easily identifiable.** <br/><br/>`community.sjmd.space > click on your user icon, click the cog ⚙️ > Preferences > Username > click edit icon (pencil)`<br/><br/>
2. **Change your profile picture to something that isn't reverse-image-search-able.**<br/><br/>`community.sjmd.space > click on your user icon, click the cog ⚙️ > Preferences > Profile Picture > click edit icon (pencil)`<br/><br/>
3. **Change your location if you're in a small town, or the only person in your area doing social justice work.**<br/><br/>`community.sjmd.space > click on your user icon, click the cog ⚙️ > Preferences > Profile (sidebar link) > Location`<br/><br/>
