Unfortunately, with things like doxxing and account theft, you don't get a warning. Once it's out, it's out.

While we'll do what we can to prevent malicious people from joining the community, we can't guarantee safety. A lot of it's up to you. So consider this your warning.

On the flipside, if you doxx someone -- either by posting private identifying details about someone in a thread or message within the Community, or by sharing someone's personal information elsewhere (e.g., on Facebook) -- you will be banned. Forever.

**Consider this your warning.**
