Unfortunately, with things like doxxing and account theft, you don't get a warning. Once it's out, it's out. 

For most of us to whom this has happened, we didn't get a warning. We were just spreading the word about things we cared about, writing articles online, or participating in social networks, totally oblivious to how easily a few devoted strangers could derail our lives. Then our lives were derailed.

**Consider this your warning.**
