**We won't be talking directly about Social Justice Dogma yet**, but laying the groundwork to do so in the next Modules.

So we want to give you a release valve first, because if it wasn't on your mind, you probably wouldn't be in this course (right?).

Reply with your current feelings about SJD, get everything off your chest, then do your best to keep all of that in mind as we explore the idea of community.
