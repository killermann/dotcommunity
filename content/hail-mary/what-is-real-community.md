Let's start by making sure we're all on the same page about what the goal is here. **Community** is a word that gets thrown around a lot these days, and has been diluted in its meaning.

For the sake of this course, and the goals of SJMD more broadly, **we're using "real community" to mean, in short, "connection + interdependence."**

For a longer definition, we'll draw from [Chapter 22](http://sacred-economics.com/sacred-economics-chapter-22-community-and-the-unquantifiable/) of [Charles Eisenstein's](https://charleseisenstein.org/) book [_Sacred Economics_](http://sacred-economics.com) (emphasis ours):

>Community, which in today’s parlance usually means proximity or a mere network, is a much deeper kind of connection than that: it is a sharing of one’s being, an expansion of one’s self. **To be in community is to be in personal, interdependent relationship**, and it comes with a price: our illusion of independence, our freedom from obligation. You can’t have it both ways. **If you want community, you must be willing to be obligated, dependent, tied, attached**. You will give and receive gifts that you cannot just buy somewhere. You will not be able to easily find another source. You need each other.
