Even before you met Jon Ronson, our guess is you had some worries about joining this online community. Further, we bet that people in your lives (who aren't in this course) have some thoughts on this as well.

Ask around (via posting an open question on Facebook/Twitter, texting friends, at the lunch table, etc.) and get a sense for whether people in your life are worried about saying the wrong thing online. If so, what shape does that worry take? Try to hear from at least 5 people. The more the better.
