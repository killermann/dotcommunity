Jargon and common phrases often stand-in for one's own lack of understanding of a topic. They're also frequently the fork in the road that begins a misunderstanding between two people.

Not feeling obligated to be kind, or seeing kindness as beneficial, can truncate our willingness to endeavor to understand someone else. Or to make ourselves understood.

And when all else fails, dehumanizing someone we disagree with is an easy way to avoid having to engage with them at all. _Monsters can't understand anyway, and they don't deserve our kindness._

**What happens when we avoid jargon and common phrases, and instead say what we mean? When we do so with kindness? When we rehumanize the people involved, particularly those we disagree with?**

We have a shot at understanding, being understood, and creating a space that has room for everyone.
