Finally, we're going to commit to re-humanizing, instead of dehumanizing.

Let Brené Brown explain it, because who could explain it better:

> Because so many time-worn systems of power have placed certain people outside the realm of what we see as human, much of our work now is more a matter of “rehumanizing.” That starts in the same place dehumanizing starts—with words and images. Today we are edging closer and closer to a world where political and ideological discourse has become an exercise in dehumanization. And social media are the primary platforms for our dehumanizing behavior. On Twitter and Facebook we can rapidly push the people with whom we disagree into the dangerous territory of moral exclusion, with little to no accountability, and often in complete anonymity.

In our language, and in our minds and hearts, we're going to keep front and center the fact that we're all of this -- social justice, the dogma, the path toward equity, and the opponents of that goal -- is about humans.

It's for humans. It's because of humans. And on the other side of the screen, we're interacting with, talking about, arguing with, sometimes furious at, _humans_.
