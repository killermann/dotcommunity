In Timothy Snyder's short book _On Tyranny_, which has "Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century" for resisting fascism, he included a chapter titled "Be kind to our language."

In it, he warns, "Avoid pronouncing the phrases everyone else does." In SJMD, we'll be doing just that.

**When there's a common phrase or jargon that regularly gets used as a shorthand for a more complicated, loaded, controversial, or misunderstood concept, don't use it.**

**What should be on our blacklist?**
