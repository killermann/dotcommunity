Around the SJMD Community, you'll undoubtedly meet lots of new people. And they'll be helpful, encouraging, answer questions, and ask good questions.

Only some of them will be facilitators -- formally, at least.

To spot a facilitator, look for the little magic wand icon below their profile picture (it's a white icon on a red circle background).

Alternatively, you can find all the facilitators at [community.sjmd.space/g/facilitators](https://community.sjmd.space/g/Facilitators).
