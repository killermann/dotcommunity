Facilitators, for the most part, will operate within the community in the same ways as any other learner. We're not claiming expertise, a moral high ground, or thinking of ourselves in any way holier than thou.

We'll be following the same [community guidelines](https://community.sjmd.space/faq), and be held to the same standards as everyone on those fronts. **We hope that you will see yourself as a facilitator, informally, sharing the responsibility of guiding the discussion in fruitful directions.**

But there are some distinctions between general learners and the formal facilitators. Below are a few.

Facilitators will be:

- Creating new categories for discussion when there's need;
- Recategorizing posts when they're dropped in the wrong bucket;
- Receiving notifications when comments are flagged, and looking into unhealthy behaviors; and
- Collectively deciding on bans if someone does something from the [How to Get Banned](https://community.sjmd.space/faq#how-to-get-banned) list.

All this goes to say: **if you need help, and you're not sure who to turn to, the facilitators are here to help.**
