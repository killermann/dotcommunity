Obviously, you got the first email from us with the link to Orientation &amp; Module 1, or you wouldn't be reading this. So that's great (no small feat, with all the hyperactive spam filters these days).

**Every week, you'll get another email with new links and resources.** If you don't see it, it's probably in your spam folder.

When you're not sure where to find something, your email is a great first place to look.
