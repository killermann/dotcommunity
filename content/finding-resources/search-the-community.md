If the resource you're looking for isn't in your email, it's probably in the community, somewhere. **Use the search to find it quickly**.

Click the magnifying glass up top (or go the [the search page](https://community.sjmd.space/search)), type a keyword or two and results will start to show up. Hopefully whatever you need is there.
