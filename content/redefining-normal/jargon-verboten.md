To start, let's build on our "Be Kind to Language" idea and create a norm that disincentivizes jargon.

In society-at-large, and within the social justice movement, jargon is a way to demonstrate prestige. It's how you say, "I know what I'm talking about," whether or not you do.

If, instead, we normalize plain language, devoid of jargon, we'll be normalizing speech that's understandable, accessible, inviting, and uniting.

So, **New Norm 1: _jargon verboten_, or, in plain speak, let's avoid jargon ðŸ˜‰.**
